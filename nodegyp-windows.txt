Getting node-gyp to work on Windows (required for buildtools, used by mjpeg-consumer):

https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/629#issuecomment-153196245



I couldn't get the 2015 build tools to work, but with 2013 already installed
it worked using:

set VCTargetsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V120
set VCTargetsPath12=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V120
npm config set msvs_version 2013
